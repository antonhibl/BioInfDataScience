Data Science that is related to Qiime2's Artifact API with Jupyter Notebook, I also explore R and various other data analysis techniques and tools.

This whole directory will be filled with notebooks, practice adn example scripts, and various data visualization techniques and tools. Use the code as much as you
would like, the hard part isn't the code but the analysis, good luck!
