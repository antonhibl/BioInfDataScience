# BioInfDataScience
Data Science that is related to Qiime2's Artifact API with Jupyter Notebook, I also explore R and various other data analysis techniques and tools.

This whole directory will be filled with notebooks, practice and example scripts, and various data visualization techniques and tools. Use the code as much as you
would like, the hard part isn't the code but the analysis, good luck!

I have started working closely with Vega-Lite as well as altair in Python, I plan to use more r going forward but for now it is more of a side task as the bulk of my analyses are done in jupyter notebook and VegaLite with r being a near future thing I would like to integrate into Qiime as I really enjoy the language. To me R is like the C of data science, every good data scientist must know it as it teaches so many fundamental concepts as well as anything can be implemented in it as long as you'll put in the effort.
